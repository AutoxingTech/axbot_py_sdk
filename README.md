# AutoXing Robot Python SDK

This project is a Python Wrapper of [Autoxing Robot REST API](https://autoxingtech.github.io/axbot_rest_book/).

Currently, this project is in the very early development stage and only covers a very small subset of the REST API.

See [patrol.py](./src/patrol/patrol.py) for an example.

To run it, use:

```
cd src
python3 -m patrol.patrol
```
